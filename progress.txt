- RunPod Python SDK Documentation: https://docs.runpod.io/tutorials/sdks/python/get-started/introduction
- MCP Documentation: https://modelcontextprotocol.io

## Phase 1: Setup & Infrastructure
- [x] Set up development environment with Python 3.9+
- [x] Install required dependencies:
  - [x] MCP Python SDK (`pip install mcp`)
  - [x] RunPod Python SDK (`pip install runpod`)
  - [x] Requests library (for direct API calls when needed)
- [x] Create project structure with clear separation of concerns
- [x] Set up version control and documentation

## Phase 2: Core MCP Server Implementation
- [x] Implement basic MCP server structure using the official MCP Python SDK
- [x] Create authentication handlers for RunPod API
- [x] Set up configuration system for API keys and endpoints
- [x] Implement logging and error handling framework

## Phase 3: Resource Implementation
- [x] Define and implement resource types for RunPod entities:
  - [x] Pod configurations and templates
  - [x] GPU types and availability
  - [x] Serverless endpoints
  - [x] Network storage
- [x] Implement resource fetchers that retrieve and format RunPod resources (using RunPod SDK/API)
- [x] Create resource schemas that properly describe RunPod entities to LLMs

## Phase 4: Tool Implementation
- [ ] Implement pod management tools:
  - [ ] Create pods
  - [ ] Start/stop/restart pods
  - [ ] Check pod status
  - [ ] Delete pods
- [ ] Implement serverless function tools:
  - [ ] Deploy serverless endpoints
  - [ ] Run serverless functions
  - [ ] Manage serverless configurations
- [ ] Implement billing and credit tools:
  - [ ] Check credit balance
  - [ ] View billing history
  - [ ] Estimate costs

## Phase 5: Prompt Templates
- [ ] Create helpful prompt templates for common RunPod operations
- [ ] Design AI-friendly instructions for GPU selection
- [ ] Develop templates for debugging common issues
- [ ] Create examples showing optimal pod configurations for different ML tasks

## Phase 6: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Develop comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Test with various LLM clients (Claude Desktop, etc.)
- [ ] Validate resource schema format and usefulness
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent access
- [ ] Security testing

## Phase 7: Documentation & Examples
- [ ] Write comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Create quickstart guides for common use cases
- [ ] Provide example code for:
  - [ ] Setting up PyTorch training on RunPod via MCP
  - [ ] Running diffusion models on RunPod GPUs
  - [ ] Managing long-running experiments
  - [ ] Deploying inference endpoints
- [ ] Document best practices and common pitfalls

## Phase 8: Deployment & Distribution
- [ ] Package code for PyPI distribution
- [ ] Create Docker container for easy deployment
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and releases
- [ ] Prepare release notes and announcement

## Phase 9: Community & Integration
- [ ] Create examples for integrating with AI assistants (Claude, etc.)
- [ ] Develop demo applications showcasing MCP capabilities
- [ ] Set up feedback channels for user suggestions
- [ ] Plan for future enhancements based on user feedback

## Example Implementation Snippets

### Basic MCP Server Structure
```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("RunPod MCP")

# Define a resource for GPU types
@mcp.resource("gpus://available")
def available_gpus() -> str:
    """Get available GPU types on RunPod"""
    # Use RunPod SDK to fetch GPU types
    # return formatted data
    
# Define a tool for creating pods
@mcp.tool()
def create_pod(gpu_type: str, memory: int, disk_size: int) -> str:
    """Create a new pod with specified configuration"""
    # Use RunPod SDK/API to create pod
    # return creation result

# Define a prompt template
@mcp.prompt()
def gpu_selection_prompt() -> str:
    """Help with selecting appropriate GPU type"""
    return """
    I need help selecting the right GPU for my workload. 
    Here are details about my task:
    - Task type: [ML training/inference/rendering]
    - Framework: [PyTorch/TensorFlow/etc.]
    - Model size: [parameters/memory requirements]
    - Batch size: [if applicable]
    """

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

### Running in Development Mode
```bash
# Fast testing with MCP Inspector
mcp dev runpod_server.py

# Install in Claude Desktop
mcp install runpod_server.py --name "RunPod MCP"
